- A command-line tool to download all your iCloud photos.
- Works on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.
- Run as executable, docker container, or from the source
- Run one time or continuously [watch for changes](#watching-icloud-for-changes) to keep a local backup of your photos and videos.

This tool is developed and maintained by volunteers (we are always looking for [help](CONTRIBUTING.md)...). We aim to release new versions once a week (Friday), if there is something worth delivering.

## Install

There are three ways to run `icloudpd`:
1. Download executable for your platform from the Github Release and run it
1. Use Docker to download and run the tool (requires Docker installed, e.g. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
1. Run from the source (requires Python and `pip` installed)

### Download with Docker

Docker automatically pulls images from the remote repository if necessary. To download explicitely, e.g. to force version update, use:

```sh
docker pull icloudpd/icloudpd:1.12.0
```

### Running from the source

`icloudpd` is a Python package that can be installed using `pip`:

``` sh
pip install icloudpd
```

> If you need to install Python, see the [Appendix](#appendix) section for instructions.

## Experimental Mode

Some changes are added to the experimental mode before they graduate into the main package. [Details](https://github.com/icloud-photos-downloader/icloud_photos_downloader/blob/master/EXPERIMENTAL.md)

Example:

```

## Authentication

If your Apple account has two-factor authentication enabled,
you will be prompted for a code when you run the script.

Two-factor authentication will expire after an interval set by Apple,
at which point you will have to re-authenticate. This interval is currently two months.

Authentication cookies will be stored in a temp directory (`/tmp/pyicloud` on Linux, or `/var/tmp/...` on macOS.) This directory can be configured with the `--cookie-directory` option.

You can receive an email notification when two-factor authentication expires by passing the
`--smtp-username` and `--smtp-password` options. Emails will be sent to `--smtp-username` by default,
or you can send to a different email address with `--notification-email`.

If you want to send notification emails using your Gmail account, and you have enabled two-factor authentication, you will need to generate an App Password at <https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords>

### System Keyring

You can store your password in the system keyring using the `icloud` command-line tool:

``` plain
$ icloud --username jappleseed@apple.com
ICloud Password for jappleseed@apple.com:
Save password in keyring? (y/N)
```

If you have stored a password in the keyring, you will not be required to provide a password
when running the script.

If you would like to delete a password stored in your system keyring,
you can clear a stored password using the `--delete-from-keyring` command-line option:

``` sh
icloud --username jappleseed@apple.com --delete-from-keyring
```

## Error on first run

When you run the script for the first time, you might see an error message like this:

``` plain
Bad Request (400)
```

This error often happens because your account hasn't used the iCloud API before, so Apple's servers need to prepare some information about your photos. This process can take around 5-10 minutes, so please wait a few minutes and try again.

If you are still seeing this message after 30 minutes, then please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/icloud-photos-downloader/icloud_photos_downloader/issues/new) and post the script output.

## Watching iCloud for changes

Most used scenario is to run `icloudpd` to periodically download new photots from iCloud. This can be achieved with parameter or external `cron` task.

> If you provide SMTP credentials, the script will send an email notification
> whenever two-step authentication expires.

### With `--watch-with-interval` parameter

You can use `--watch-with-interval` parameter to keep `icloudpd` watching for iCloud changes. `icloudpd` will indefinately repeat downloading instructions with specified pause between them, except for authentication, which is performed only once.

### With Cron task

Alternatively, you can run `icloudpd` using `cron` on platforms that support it:

- copy the example cron script from source tree, e.g. `cp cron_script.sh.example cron_script.sh`

- Update `cron_script.sh` with your username, password, and other options

- Edit your "crontab" with `crontab -e`, then add the following line:

``` plain
0 */6 * * * /path/to/cron_script.sh
```

Now the script will run every 6 hours to download any new photos and videos.

> `cron` tries to authenticate on each run 

## Docker

This script is available in a Docker image: `docker pull icloudpd/icloudpd:1.12.0`

Usage (Downloads all photos to ./Photos):

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name icloudpd \
    -v $(pwd)/Photos:/data \
    -v $(pwd)/cookies:/cookies \
    -e TZ=America/Los_Angeles \
    icloudpd/icloudpd:latest \
    icloudpd --directory /data \
    --cookie-directory /cookies \
    --folder-structure {:%Y/%Y-%m-%d} \
    --username testuser@example.com \
    --password pass1234 \
    --size original \
    --recent 500 \
    --auto-delete
```

On Windows:

- use `%cd%` instead of `$(pwd)`
- or full path, e.g. `-v c:/photos/icloud:/data`

Building image locally from the source tree:

```bash
docker build . -t icloudpd:dev
docker run -it --rm icloudpd:dev icloudpd --version
```
